Several issues have been identified within the current Morpheus MRC (Morpheus Request for Comments) system. This document proposes targeted solutions to enhance clarity, efficiency, and community involvement with the aim of amending MRC 00 to reflect these improvements, ensuring a more transparent, organized, and community-driven process.

## Proposal Summary

### Issue: Non-Adherence to Contribution Protocols
**Problem:** Despite guidelines that contributions must be linked to an approved MRC to earn MOR allocations, MOR is being distributed for contributions not tied to approved MRCs.
**Solution:** Implement a stricter verification process for MOR distributions, mandating a connection to approved MRCs for all contributions. For Contributions exceeding X weights, link to an approved MRC is required.

### Issue: Inconsistency with MRC 00 Standards
**Problem:** Some approved MRCs do not follow the MRC 00 specified format, questioning the process's consistency.
**Solution:** Enforce a review process for MRC 00 format adherence prior to approval. Return non-compliant MRCs for revision.

### Issue: Author Identification Discrepancies
**Problem:** Discrepancies in author usernames across GitHub and Discord hinder collaboration.
**Solution:** Amend MRC 00 to require Discord handles in MRC submissions, simplifying community communication.

### Issue: One-Size-Fits-All MRC Format
**Problem:** The current MRC format does not differentiate between governance proposals and funding requests.
**Solution:** Update MRC 00 to establish distinct formats for governance-related and funding-related MRCs.

### Issue: Overwhelming Number of MRCs
**Problem:** A large volume of MRCs makes identifying relevant proposals challenging.
**Solution:** Introduce a categorization system within MRC 00 and appoint category leads through community elections to streamline the process.

### Issue: Handling Duplicate MRCs
**Problem:** No clear process exists for managing duplicate MRCs.
**Solution:** Develop a formal procedure for merging or deciding on duplicates, including an elected overseer for such processes.

The Morpheus community is encouraged to review, discuss, and contribute to these proposals, collaborating towards a more efficient Morpheus. 

# MRC 00: Morpheus Request for Comment (MRC) Update

## Introduction
MRC, meaning Morpheus Request for Comments, is integral in suggesting and executing changes within the Morpheus ecosystem. This document is designed to make the submission process more transparent, fair, and efficient.

## Purpose and Scope
This guide is crafted for contributors and users within the MOR Ecosystem, facilitating structured proposals for governance standards and material funding requests.

## Submission Timeline and Platforms
Proposals are welcome on GitHub during the Fair Launch phase, eventually moving to MOR.Software for broader community interaction.

## Writing a Well-Formed MRC
To draft a compelling MRC, study existing examples to grasp the expected format and substance. Use the provided templates for governance standards and funding requests to structure your proposal.
